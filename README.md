# Youtube looper
Repeat a single youtube item. You don't need ListenToYoutube anymore to just listen to one song repeatedly.

## Example
```python
python3 youtube-looper.py YOUTUBE_URL # (url is optional)
```

## Dependencies
* Python 3
* Selenium

## Status
* No url validation checking
* No tests
* Not enough exception handling

## Note
This is for my own understanding of Selenium. This is NOT for real life use as its coverage is 0%.
